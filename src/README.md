# NeuralNetworkTesting

## These files contain everything that is needed to create, train, use, save, read, and edit a simple Neural Network!
### The code is fully commented, so you can see how a Neural network works from the ground up. The class "Main.java" contains example creation, training, saving, reading, and testing of a network.

### <b>Current Features:</b> Unlimited layer expansion (theoretically), Backpropagation, Variable activation functions, Variable cost function, Stochastic, Batch, or Mini-batch gradient descent, L2 regularization, Trained network save/read

#### Meta info: This project was completed without the use of external libraries and is "pure java" This whole project took about one week to make, another to refine, and another to comment. Let me know if you want to see any features or functionality added. Enjoy!
